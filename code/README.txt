# Trained GNN framework

Considering that our manuscript has not been published yet, now only trained model is provided. However, you can still see "model.py" and hyper "parameter and network parameter settings .json" to know the whole network architecture and hyper parameter setting for training.

Upon reasonable request, you may obtain the codes for training from the corresponding author changsheng@whu.edu.cn

To evaluate the trained framework, You may run "predict.py" to see the predicted band structures with comparison to ab initio ones. Change the'predict_structure_cif_path' and 'references' for predicting for other graphene nanoribbon systems other than the given example.
