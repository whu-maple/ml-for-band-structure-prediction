# Code implementation

The 'core' fold consists of the code implementation of the ML framework presented in the manuscript.

The 'script_*.py' files provide the scripts for training the ML framework, and their hyper-parameter settings are stored in 'script_*_config.json'.

The 'results' fold collects the final parameters of the trained ML models.

The 'predict.py' file uses a trained ML framework for predicting the band structures of GNRs.
